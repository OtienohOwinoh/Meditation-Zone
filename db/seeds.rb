tutorial4=Tutorial.create(name:  "15 Minute Upper Body Dumbbell Workout [Strength Training]" ,description:"Tap in with us for a 15 minute upper body dumbbell workout that will help you build muscle (tone) and strength! This workout is designed for moderate to heavy resistance so you'll want to use a pair of dumbbells that are heavy enough to challenge yourself with each movement. If you're looking to build strength or muscle, we recommend going heavier in weight. For fat loss and muscular endurance, increase the temp with lighter weights. Each movement will finish with a 15 second iso metric hold to maximize those strength gains! Feel free to repeat this circuit for multiple sets for better results!  As always, try out the workout and let us know how you did! ðŸ”¥" ,url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDOlPdyZLMg" ,trainer_id:trainer2.id)
